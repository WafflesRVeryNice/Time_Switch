# Time Switch
### A mod for Celeste based on the time switch mechanic in Titanfall 2's effect and Cause

The mod works by teleporting the player between 2 rooms based on the rooms' names  

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/WafflesRVeryNice/Time_Switch/wiki) for information on how to use the mod


## Trivia
This mod took approximately 20.5 hours to make functional (recorded 20:22:29) across 5 almost consecutive days

\+ 2:22:52 - eating a waffle to celebrate and writing comments & credits

\+ 3:12:00 approx - adding manual IL hook to stop player's dash resetting when teleporting

\+ 16:29:35 - for v1.0.0 -> v1.1.0  

\+ 32:44:45 - for v1.1.0 -> v1.3.2
