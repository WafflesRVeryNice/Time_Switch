### A mod for Celeste Ripping off Titanfall 2

This code mod for Celeste teleports the player between 2 sets of rooms like in Tianfall 2's Effect and Cause where the player is teleported between 2 versions of the map


This mod took approximately 20.5 hours to make (recorded 20:22:29) over the course of 5 almost consecutive days (took a one day break, after only 4.2 hours in, past me was lazy)

\+ 2:22:52 - eating a waffle to celebrate and writing first comments & credits

\+ 3:12:00 approx - adding manual IL hook to stop player's dash resetting when teleporting



## Important

This mod assumes the map uses the room name format `a00roomName`, `b00roomName`, `a01roomName`, `b01roomName` etc
